# 16thJan
Spotify Stats Tracker 


all files in master,
rspotify.py is for spotify tracking. it requires you to set up a .env file with the following format:

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=\n
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=\n
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback

16thJan.py is the python code for the app. It takes the output excel file from rspotify.py and uses that.
